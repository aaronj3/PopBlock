## [PopBlock live site!](https://popblock.onrender.com)


## Background


PopBlock is a ranking app that allows users to make posts tied to an area on a map.
Users get to like posts when they are in a specific area, and the user with the most liked post gets to lay “claim” to that area. They will be given bragging rights fit for a king/queen… until another worthy challenger comes and is deemed by the public as the new victor. PopBlock aims to bring together communities through a fun, interactive, and localised way.
